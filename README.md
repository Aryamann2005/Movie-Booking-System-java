Movie Ticket Booking System

The Movie Ticket Booking System is a web-based Java project developed using JSP, Servlets, XML, and MySQL. It allows users to browse movies, select showtimes, reserve seats in real time, and make secure online payments. The system includes an admin panel for managing movies, schedules, and reports. XML is used for real-time seat tracking to prevent double booking. This project ensures automation, accuracy, and user convenience in the movie booking process.
